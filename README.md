# Problem Statement

There is a requirement of a ventor agnostic data-model for configuration and operational data for controlling networking devices. All network configurations should be able to modelled in this language and should be communicated to destination device either in chosen native data-model or a tranform function should be provided to convert to defined data-model of vendor device.

# Solution Approach
- openconfig data-model is selected as vendor-neutral data-model to express network configurations
- Few vendors understand openconfig data-model as it is so no transformation is required to control these devices
- For vendors who do not talk in openconfig, a tranformation path is provided

# Example usage
- Define your configs in openconfig model in a file and keep it in valid path as any other ansible template file
- This openconfig template file supports jinja2 directives so you can define variable which can be declared per
  host or group as per requirements
- use new module provided as part of this role 'openconfig_parser' to parse the configs in openconfig or native
  vendor model. 
- Conversion schema from openconfig to vendor native format should be provided by argument 'xpath_map' to above role
- use 'netconf_config' module to play configs produced to destination device
